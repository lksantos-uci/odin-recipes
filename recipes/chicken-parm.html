        <ul class = "ingredients">
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 ounces dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>16 ounce jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>2 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Steps -->
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Pour egg into a small shallow bowl. Place bread crumbs in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken into egg, then into bread crumbs. Place coated chicken on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink and juices run clear, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 of the spaghetti sauce into a 7x11-inch baking dish. Place chicken breasts over the sauce, then cover with remaining sauce. Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses on top.</li>
            <li>Continue baking until heated through and cheeses have melted, about 20 more minutes.</li>
        </ol>
